I am currently a senior at UNC Chapel Hill double majoring in Biostatistics, B.S.P.H. and Mathematics, B.S. with a minor in Chemistry. 

I have been working at the [UNC BRAIN Lab](https://bbm.web.unc.edu/) 
in the [Biomedical Research Imaging Center (BRIC)](https://www.med.unc.edu/bric/) at UNC Chapel Hill as a Research Assistant
since September 2021 under the supervision of Dr. Gang Li. 
My work focuses on developing infant-dedicated deep learning tools for image registration and volumetric atlas construction for the early developing brain.

Currently, I am a visiting student at the [Advanced MRI Acquisition Lab](https://mriacq-lab.martinos.org) at the [Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging](https://www.martinos.org) at Massachusetts General Hospital under the supervision of Dr. Fuyixue Wang and Dr. Zijing Dong.

During regular semesters, I work as a Learning Assistant for BIOL 252L: Fundamentals of Human Anatomy and Physiology Laboratory. 
I have been volunteering at the Emergency Department at UNC Hospitals since January 2023.

In my free time, I enjoy snowboarding, badminton, cooking Chinese food, and [photography](https://kvttt.myportfolio.com/).

[//]: # (I am looking for a Ph.D. position in Biophysics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, and/or Biomedical Engineering starting in Fall 2025.)

RESEARCH INTERESTS
------------------

I have always wanted to **improve the health outcomes of patients** using my quantitative background. 
Of course, this is a very broad aim, and it encompasses a wide range of stuff.
For example, it involves **pushing the resolution and SNR limits of MRI** to allow identification of potential biomarkers that are previously inaccessible due to hardware and software limitations;
it involves using **biostatistics** to establish the relationship between these biomarkers and disease progression/prognosis;
it also involves **developing deep learning tools** that assist and accelerate the workflow of radiologists during diagnosis/treatment planning.

Here is a list of areas that I am particularly interested in:

* Image acquisition and reconstruction
  * Deep learning reconstruction
  * Accelerated acquisition

* Medical image analysis 
  * Volume and surface registrations
  * Atlas construction
  * Cortical surface reconstruction

* Explainable Deep Learning

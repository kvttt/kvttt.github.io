I recently graduated from UNC Chapel Hill with a Bachelor of Science in Public Health in Biostatistics, a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics, and a minor in Chemistry. 

During my time at UNC Chapel Hill, I had worked at the [UNC BRAIN Lab](https://bbm.web.unc.edu/) 
in the [Biomedical Research Imaging Center (BRIC)](https://www.med.unc.edu/bric/) as a Research Assistant
since September 2021 under the supervision of Dr. Gang Li. 
My work focuses on developing infant-dedicated deep learning tools for image registration and volumetric atlas construction for the early developing brain.

Currently, I am a visiting student at the [Advanced MRI Acquisition Lab](https://mriacq-lab.martinos.org) at the [Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging](https://www.martinos.org) at Massachusetts General Hospital under the supervision of Dr. Fuyixue Wang and Dr. Zijing Dong.
My research focuses on developing deep learning reconstruction and accelerated acquisition methods to achieve fast and robust mesoscale diffusion MRI in vivo.

I previously worked as a Learning Assistant for BIOL 252L: Fundamentals of Human Anatomy and Physiology Laboratory for 4 semesters. 
I had also been volunteering at the Emergency Department at UNC Hospitals for 2 years since January 2023.

In my free time, I enjoy snowboarding, badminton, cooking Chinese food, and [photography](https://kvttt.myportfolio.com/).

RESEARCH INTERESTS
------------------

I have always wanted to **improve the health outcomes of patients** using my quantitative background. 
Of course, this is a very broad aim, and it encompasses a wide range of stuff.
For example, it involves **pushing the resolution and SNR limits of MRI** to allow identification of potential biomarkers that are previously inaccessible due to hardware and software limitations;
it involves using **biostatistics** to establish the relationship between these biomarkers and disease progression/prognosis;
it also involves **developing deep learning tools** that assist and accelerate the workflow of radiologists during diagnosis/treatment planning.

Here is a list of areas that I am particularly interested in:

* Image acquisition and reconstruction
  * Deep learning reconstruction
  * Accelerated acquisition

* Medical image analysis 
  * Volume and surface registrations
  * Atlas construction
  * Cortical surface reconstruction

* Explainable Deep Learning
